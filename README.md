# Introduction

This is a blinded repo dedicated to submission 37.

The repo is blinded using Anonymous GitHub for Open-Science (https://anonymous.4open.science/).

# Structure

This repository includes NRG's code and supporting data. Pcap traces are omitted due to their size. 

The repo is organized as follows:

1. NRG - NRG source code, including hardware and software.

2. data - supporting data, such as evaluation results and generated network profiles.

Refer to the README.md file under each folder for more information.


# Installation

This is a preliminary release, for submission purposes only. A full release will be automated.

To compile and run NRG you will need access to the following repositories:

1. NetFPGA SUME repository: https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-SUME-live (requires registration).

2. P4-NetFPGA repository: https://github.com/NetFPGA/P4-NetFPGA-live/ (requires registration).

3. Emu repository: https://github.com/NaaS/emu-live

P4-NetFPGA and Emu are required only to run P4 and Emu based mini-blocks. 


# Blinding

This repository contains in some files copyrights of authors and named sources, especially under the NRG/hw/ folder. These are not unblinding the code, but are inherited from the NetFPGA repositories under the NetFPGA C.I.C redistribution license.
