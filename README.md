# Introduction

This is a blinded repo dedicated to submission 332.

The repo is blinded using Anonymous GitHub for Open-Science (https://anonymous.4open.science/).

# Important: Blinding Disclaimer

This repository contains some files with copyrights of authors and named sources, especially under the NRG/hw/ folder. These are not unblinding the code, but were inherited from the NetFPGA repositories under the NetFPGA C.I.C redistribution license. 

Every effort was taken as part of this release to blind any identifying information of the authors. 



# Structure

This repository includes NRG's code and supporting data. Pcap traces are omitted due to their size. 

The repo is organized as follows:

1. NRG - NRG source code, including hardware and software.

2. data - supporting data, such as evaluation results and generated network profiles.

Refer to the README.md file under each folder for more information.


# Installation

This is a preliminary release, for submission purposes only. A full release will be automated.

To compile and run NRG you will need access to the following repositories:

1. NetFPGA SUME repository: https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-SUME-live (requires registration).

2. P4-NetFPGA repository: https://github.com/NetFPGA/P4-NetFPGA-live/ (requires registration).

3. Emu repository: https://github.com/NaaS/emu-live

P4-NetFPGA and Emu are required only to run P4 and Emu based mini-blocks.
