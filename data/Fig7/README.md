# Figure 7

This directory contains the data used to generate Figure 7.

Fig7.txt contains the processed results.

apache_sample contains a sample of some of the files used to log the results of an experiment, on a single machine, in a single run, for a given latency and benchmark.  Additional files that are omitted for blinding are syslog and kern.log.

The full data set is 23GB in size, and contains about 12K files.

The scripts used to run the test are unblinding, and will be included in the final release.
