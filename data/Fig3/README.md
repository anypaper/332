# Figure 3

This directory contains the data used to generate Figure 3.

The log files contain the processed results. Each row in the file represents a bandwidth configuration, and each column represents a latency configuration.

tensorflow_a.log: the results used to generate Figure 3a.

apache_b.log: the results used to generate Figure 3b.

memcached_c.log: the results used to generate Figure 3c. 

The full data set is 96GB in size, and contains about 88K files.

The example included under Fig7/apache_sample is indicative of one sample point used in the generation of Figure 3(b).

The scripts used to run the test are unblinding, and will be included in the final release.
