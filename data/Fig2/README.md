# Figure 2

This directory contains the following:

1. The bash scripts used to drive the experiments in Figure 2:

- ping_netem - benchmark netem using Ping (low load)

- ping_nrg - benchmark nrg using Ping (low load)

- iperf_netem - benchmark netem using iperf3 (medium and high load)

- iperf_nrg - benchmark nrg using iperf3 (medium and high load)

2. All the latency distributions collected as part of the experiment.

Expcap files will be released with the final version of the paper. Each pcap file is about 40MB, and there are 160 files per experiment (line). The overall database is ~50GB in size.
